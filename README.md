# Skript determining the duration of interactions

After performing Molecular Dynamics simulations with Schr√∂dinger Desmond, interactions between residues or other molecules present in the simulation can be exportet in individual files using e.g. the Simulations-Interactions-Diagramm Tool. Interactions are saved framewise as follows: 

    /# Frame#   Residue#      Chain    ResName   AtomName  LigandFragment      LigandAtom   Distance
         0          1          A        GLU        OE2        L-FRAG_0         Na00001      1.000 
         0          2          A        ASP        OD2        L-FRAG_0         Na00002      1.000

This skript summarizes interactions that are present in consecutive frames. In the dataset above, Residue #1 shows interactions to the same LigandAtom (Na00001) in all three frames (0, 1, 2). Similarly, Residue #2 shows interactions with the same interaction partner over three frames. Residue #3, however, shows no interaction in Frame 1. This skript summarizes these data and produces a .csv-File as output as follows: 

    res,chain,duration      <- Headline
    1,A,3                   <- Residue 1 of chain A showed an interaction that lasted for three frames (Frames: 0, 1, 2)
    2,A,3                   <- Residue 2 of chain A showed an interaction that lasted for three frames (Frames: 0, 1, 2)
    3,A,1                   <- Residue 3 of chain A showed an interaction that lasted for one frame    (Frame: 0)
    3,A,1                   <- Residue 3 of chain A showed an interaction that lasted for one frame    (Frame: 2)
    [...]

In the skript, it is necessary to specify the File Path of the exported data in `filename` and `filepath` variables, as well as a path for the output file in `resultspath`. Moreover, chains and residues of interest need to be specified in arrays `chains` and `resnums`, respectively.  

> [!TIP]
> If desired, interactions can be deemed continuous despite small gaps in which the interaction was not observed. Therefore, edit the value of the `allowedDifference` variable. A value of 1 means that frames must be consecutive, a value of 2 would e.g. allow (multiple) gaps of 1 Frame in an interaction. 

The repository contains a version with detailed comments on how the skript works and an additional uncommented version.
